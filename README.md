# Agent-Native Database for Multi-Agent Systems

ANDB (CogDB) is a v1 prototype of an agent-native database for multi-agent systems (MAS). The repository combines a tiered segment-oriented retrieval plane, an event backbone with append-only WAL, a canonical object materialization layer, pre-computed evidence fragments, 1-hop graph expansion, and structured evidence assembly — all wired together as a single runnable Go server.

The core thesis is simple:

**agent memory, state, event, artifact, and relation should be modeled as first-class database objects, and query results should return structured evidence rather than only top-k text fragments.**

## Project Status

This repository is in the **runnable-prototype** stage.  The main ingest/query path is fully wired end-to-end.

What is implemented today:

- Runnable Go server in [`src/cmd/server/main.go`](src/cmd/server/main.go) with 10 HTTP routes
- Append-only WAL with `Scan` and `LatestLSN` for replay and watermark tracking
- `MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult` that produces a canonical `Memory`, `ObjectVersion`, and typed `Edge` records at ingest time
- Three-tier data plane: **hot** (in-memory LRU cache) → **warm** (full segment index) → **cold** (archived tier), all behind a unified `DataPlane` interface
- Pre-computed `EvidenceFragment` cache populated at ingest, merged into proof traces at query time
- 1-hop graph expansion via `GraphEdgeStore.BulkEdges` in the `Assembler.Build` path
- `QueryResponse` returns `Objects`, `Edges`, `Provenance`, and `ProofTrace` in every response
- Module-level test coverage: 12 packages each with their own `*_test.go` file
- Python SDK bootstrap and demo scripts
- Architecture, schema, and milestone documentation

What is still intentionally lightweight in v1:

- Distributed runtime and persistence
- Full policy/governance execution
- Deep proof construction beyond 1-hop
- Production-grade indexing and optimization

## Why This Project Exists

Most current agent memory stacks look like one of the following:

1. a vector database plus metadata tables
2. a chunk store used for RAG
3. an application-level event log or cache
4. a graph layer that is disconnected from retrieval execution

These approaches are useful but incomplete for MAS workloads that need:

- event-centric state evolution
- objectified memory and state management
- multi-representation retrieval
- provenance-preserving evidence return
- relation expansion and traceable derivation
- version-aware reasoning context

ANDB treats the database as cognitive infrastructure, not only as storage.

## v1 Design Goals

- Store canonical cognitive objects, not only vectors or chunks.
- Drive state evolution through events and materialization, not direct overwrite.
- Support dense, sparse, and filter-aware retrieval over object projections.
- Return structured evidence packages with provenance, versions, and proof notes.
- Keep contracts stable enough for parallel development across modules.

## Current Architecture

The system is organized around three execution layers:

```
HTTP API (access)
    └─ Runtime (worker)
          ├─ WAL + Bus  (eventbackbone)
          ├─ MaterializeEvent → Memory / ObjectVersion / Edges  (materialization)
          ├─ PreComputeService → EvidenceFragment cache  (materialization)
          ├─ HotCache → TieredDataPlane (hot→warm→cold)  (dataplane)
          └─ Assembler.Build → BulkEdges + EvidenceCache  (evidence)
```

**Ingest path:**
`API → WAL.Append → MaterializeEvent → PutMemory + PutVersion + PutEdge → PreCompute → HotCache → TieredDataPlane.Ingest`

**Query path:**
`API → TieredDataPlane.Search → Assembler.Build → EvidenceCache.GetMany + BulkEdges(1-hop) → QueryResponse{Objects, Edges, ProofTrace}`

Code layout:

- [`src/internal/access`](src/internal/access): HTTP gateway, 10 routes including ingest, query, and canonical CRUD
- [`src/internal/coordinator`](src/internal/coordinator): 9 coordinators (schema, object, policy, version, worker, memory, index, shard, query) + module registry
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone`](src/internal/eventbackbone): WAL (`Append`/`Scan`/`LatestLSN`), Bus, HybridClock, WatermarkPublisher, DerivationLog
- [`src/internal/worker`](src/internal/worker): `Runtime.SubmitIngest` and `Runtime.ExecuteQuery` wiring
- [`src/internal/worker/nodes`](src/internal/worker/nodes): 14 worker-node type contracts (data, index, query, memory extraction, graph, proof trace, etc.)
- [`src/internal/dataplane`](src/internal/dataplane): `TieredDataPlane` (hot/warm/cold), `SegmentDataPlane`, and `DataPlane` interface
- [`src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore`](src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore): `Index`, `Shard`, `Searcher`, `Planner` — the physical segment layer
- [`src/internal/materialization`](src/internal/materialization): `Service.MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult{Record, Memory, Version, Edges}`; `PreComputeService`
- [`src/internal/evidence`](src/internal/evidence): `Assembler` (cache-aware, graph-expansion via `WithEdgeStore`), `EvidenceFragment`, `Cache`
- [`src/internal/storage`](src/internal/storage): 7 stores + `HotObjectCache` + `TieredObjectStore`; `GraphEdgeStore` with `BulkEdges`/`DeleteEdge`
- [`src/internal/semantic`](src/internal/semantic): `ObjectModelRegistry`, `PolicyEngine`, 5 query plan types
- [`src/internal/schemas`](src/internal/schemas): 13 canonical Go types + query/response contracts
- [`sdk/python`](sdk/python): Python SDK and bootstrap scripts
- [`cpp`](cpp): C++ retrieval stub for future high-performance execution
- [`src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane`](src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane): imported retrieval-plane source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/coordinator/controlplane`](src/internal/coordinator/controlplane): imported control-plane source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane`](src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane): imported stream/event source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/platformpkg`](src/internal/platformpkg): imported shared platform package subtree

## Canonical Objects in v1

The main v1 objects are:

- `Agent`
- `Session`
- `Event`
- `Memory`
- `State`
- `Artifact`
- `Edge`
- `ObjectVersion`

The current authoritative Go definitions live in [`src/internal/schemas/canonical.go`](src/internal/schemas/canonical.go).

## Query Contract in v1

The implemented ingest-to-query path:

`event ingest → canonical object materialization → retrieval projection → tiered search (hot→warm→cold) → 1-hop graph expansion → pre-computed evidence merge → structured QueryResponse`

The `QueryResponse` returned from every query includes:

- `Objects` — retrieved object IDs ranked by lexical score
- `Edges` — 1-hop graph neighbours of all retrieved objects
- `Provenance` — list of pipeline stages that contributed (`event_projection`, `retrieval_projection`, `fragment_cache`, `graph_expansion`)
- `Versions` — object version records (populated by version-aware queries)
- `AppliedFilters` — filters derived from the request by the `PolicyEngine`
- `ProofTrace` — step-by-step trace of how the response was assembled

Go contracts live in [`src/internal/schemas/query.go`](src/internal/schemas/query.go). Richer intended semantics are documented in the schema docs below.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go toolchain
- Python 3
- `pip`

### Install Python SDK dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./sdk/python
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
make dev
```

By default the server listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. You can override it with `ANDB_HTTP_ADDR`.

### Seed a mock event

```bash
python scripts/seed_mock_data.py
```

### Run the demo query

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

To run only the Go internal module tests:

```bash
go test ./src/internal/... -count=1 -timeout 30s
```

All 12 native packages have their own `*_test.go` file.  See [`docs/contributing.md §11`](docs/contributing.md) for the module-level test specification.

## Collaboration Principles

This repository follows a framework-first development model:

1. freeze the main flow before scaling modules
2. freeze shared schemas before parallel implementation
3. validate the end-to-end path before optimizing internals
4. keep v1 focused on proving the architectural thesis

If you are starting implementation work, read [`docs/v1-scope.md`](docs/v1-scope.md) and [`docs/contributing.md`](docs/contributing.md) first.

## Near-Term Milestone

The implemented v1 prototype can already demonstrate:

- event ingest through the public API (`POST /v1/ingest/events`)
- `MaterializeEvent` → canonical `Memory`, `ObjectVersion`, and `Edge` records written to stores
- tiered retrieval (hot → warm → cold) over canonical-object projections
- 1-hop graph expansion in every `QueryResponse`
- pre-computed `EvidenceFragment` cache merged into `ProofTrace` at query time

Next milestones:

- benchmark comparison against simple top-k return
- time-travel queries using WAL `Scan` replay
- multi-agent session isolation and scope enforcement

## Long-Term Direction

Later versions may extend ANDB with:

- policy-aware retrieval and visibility enforcement
- stronger version/time semantics
- share contracts and governance objects
- richer graph reasoning and proof replay
- tensor memory operators
- cloud-native distributed orchestration

v1 does not aim to complete that roadmap. It aims to establish the right abstraction and the right main path.
