# CogDB — Agent-Native Database for Multi-Agent Systems
> **Branch:** `dev` (integration) · **Pass 9** (2026-03-28)

CogDB (ANDB) is an agent-native database for multi-agent systems (MAS). It combines a tiered segment-oriented retrieval plane, an event backbone with an append-only WAL, a canonical object materialization layer, pre-computed evidence fragments, 1-hop graph expansion, and structured evidence assembly — all wired together as a single runnable Go server.

> **Core thesis:** agent memory, state, event, artifact, and relation should be modeled as first-class database objects, and query results should return structured evidence rather than only top-k text fragments.

## What is implemented

- Go server ([`src/cmd/server/main.go`](src/cmd/server/main.go)) with 14 HTTP routes, graceful shutdown via `context.WithCancel`
- Admin dataset cleanup: `POST /v1/admin/dataset/delete` soft-deletes **Memory** records whose `Memory.Content` matches the given selectors (**AND** semantics). **`workspace_id` is required.** At least one of `file_name`, `dataset_name`, or `prefix` is required. `dry_run` only reports matches without mutating. After soft delete, cold-tier embeddings for those memories are best-effort removed via the tiered store.
  - Matching rules: if `file_name` is set, content must contain `dataset=<file_name>`; if `dataset_name` is set, content must contain `dataset_name:<dataset_name>`; if `prefix` is set, content must contain `dataset=<prefix` (prefix-style substring on the `dataset=` marker).
  - Example bodies: `{"file_name":"deep1B.ibin","workspace_id":"w_member_a_dataset","dry_run":true}` · `{"file_name":"base.10M.fbin","dataset_name":"deep1B","workspace_id":"w_demo","dry_run":false}`
  - Response fields include `matched`, `deleted`, and `memory_ids` (all memory IDs that matched the selectors; in `dry_run`, `deleted` stays `0` while `memory_ids` still lists matches).
- Admin dataset **purge** (hard remove): `POST /v1/admin/dataset/purge` uses the same selectors and **`workspace_id` (required)**. It physically removes matching memories from hot/warm/cold tiers, warm graph edges, cold embeddings, and cold memory blobs. By default `only_if_inactive` is **true** (only memories already soft-deleted / inactive are purged); set `only_if_inactive` to `false` to also purge active matches. `dry_run` reports `matched`, `skipped_active`, `purgeable`, and `purged` without deleting. Each successful purge appends an immutable `AuditRecord` with `reason_code=dataset_purge`.
- Append-only WAL with `Scan` and `LatestLSN` for replay and watermark tracking
- `MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult` producing canonical `Memory`, `ObjectVersion`, and typed `Edge` records at ingest time
- Synchronous object materialization: `ObjectMaterializationWorker`, `ToolTraceWorker`, and `StateCheckpoint` called in `SubmitIngest` so State/Artifact/Version objects are immediately queryable
- Supplemental canonical retrieval in `ExecuteQuery`: State/Artifact IDs fetched from ObjectStore alongside retrieval-plane results
- Event store: `ObjectStore` supports Event CRUD; `QueryChain.Run` routes `evt_`/`art_` IDs to load Event/Artifact GraphNodes
- Three-tier data plane: **hot** (in-memory LRU) → **warm** (segment index, hybrid when embedder set) → **cold** (S3 or in-mem), behind a unified `DataPlane` interface
- **RRF fusion** across hot + warm + cold candidate lists for rank fusion
- Dual storage backends: in-memory (default) and Badger-backed persistent storage (`ANDB_STORAGE=disk`), with per-store hybrid mode; `GET /v1/admin/storage` reports resolved config
- Pre-computed `EvidenceFragment` cache populated at ingest, merged into proof traces at query time; `QueryResponse.EvidenceCache` reports hit/miss stats
- 1-hop graph expansion via `GraphEdgeStore.BulkEdges` in the `Assembler.Build` path
- `QueryResponse` with `Objects`, `Edges`, `Provenance`, `ProofTrace`, `Versions`, `AppliedFilters`, `ChainTraces`, `EvidenceCache`, and `chain_traces` (main/memory_pipeline/query/collaboration slots) on every query
- `QueryChain` (post-retrieval reasoning): multi-hop BFS proof trace + 1-hop subgraph expansion, merged deduplicated into response
- `include_cold` query flag wired through planner and TieredDataPlane to force cold-tier merge even when hot satisfies TopK
- Algorithm dispatch: `DispatchAlgorithm`, `DispatchRecall`, `DispatchShare`, `DispatchConflictResolve` on Runtime; pluggable `MemoryManagementAlgorithm` interface with `BaselineMemoryAlgorithm` (default) and `MemoryBankAlgorithm` (8-dimension governance model)
- **MemoryBank governance**: 8 lifecycle states (candidate→active→reinforced→compressed→stale→quarantined→archived→deleted), conflict detection (value contradiction, preference reversal, factual disagreement, entity conflict), profile management
- All algorithm parameters externalized to `configs/algorithm_memorybank.yaml` and `configs/algorithm_baseline.yaml`
- Safe DLQ: panic recovery with overflow buffer (capacity 256) + structured `OverflowBuffer()` + `OverflowCount` metrics — panics are never silently lost
- 10 embedding providers: `TfidfEmbedder` (pure-Go), `OpenAIEmbedder` (OpenAI/Azure/Ollama/ZhipuAI), `CohereEmbedder`, `VertexAIEmbedder`, `HuggingFaceEmbedder`, `OnnxEmbedder`, `GGUFEmbedder` (go-llama.cpp/Metal), `TensorRTEmbedder` (stub); ZhipuAI and Ollama real-API tests PASS
- Module-level test coverage: 22 packages with `*_test.go`
- Python SDK (`sdk/python`) and demo scripts
- Full architecture, schema, and API documentation

## Dataset bulk import and CLI delete / purge (E2E)

Use [`scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py`](scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py) to push vector-style files into ANDB via `POST /v1/ingest/events`, or to call `POST /v1/admin/dataset/delete` / `POST /v1/admin/dataset/purge` in a loop over matched files (purge only removes rows that are already soft-deleted unless you pass `--purge-include-active`).

- **Supported suffixes:** `.fvecs`, `.ivecs`, `.ibin`, `.fbin`, `.arrow` (`.arrow` requires `pyarrow` from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)).
- **Markers in ingested text:** each event’s `payload.text` includes `dataset=<file_basename>` and `dataset_name:<--dataset>` so you can delete either by file name, by dataset label, or both together (aligned with the admin delete API above).
- **`.ibin` dtype:** use `--ibin-dtype auto|float32|int32` when auto-detection by filename is wrong for your file.
- **Examples** (set `ANDB_BASE_URL` if the server is not `http://127.0.0.1:8080`):

```bash
# Ingest (limit rows per file)
python3 scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py --file /path/to/base.10M.fbin --dataset deep1B --limit 200 --workspace-id w_demo

# Delete dry-run (per file under --file: sends file_name + dataset_name + workspace_id)
python3 scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py --delete --delete-dry-run --file /path/to/base.10M.fbin --dataset deep1B --workspace-id w_demo

# Delete for real
python3 scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py --delete --file /path/to/base.10M.fbin --dataset deep1B --workspace-id w_demo

# Purge dry-run (after soft delete; by dataset + workspace, or add --file to scope per basename)
python3 scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py --purge --purge-dry-run --dataset deep1B --workspace-id w_demo

# Purge for real (default: only inactive memories)
python3 scripts/e2e/import_dataset.py --purge --file /path/to/base.10M.fbin --dataset deep1B --workspace-id w_demo
```

## Why This Project Exists

Most current agent memory stacks look like one of the following:

1. a vector database plus metadata tables
2. a chunk store used for RAG
3. an application-level event log or cache
4. a graph layer that is disconnected from retrieval execution

These approaches are useful but incomplete for MAS workloads that need:

- event-centric state evolution
- objectified memory and state management
- multi-representation retrieval
- provenance-preserving evidence return
- relation expansion and traceable derivation
- version-aware reasoning context

ANDB treats the database as cognitive infrastructure, not only as storage.

## v1 Design Goals

- Store canonical cognitive objects, not only vectors or chunks.
- Drive state evolution through events and materialization, not direct overwrite.
- Support dense, sparse, and filter-aware retrieval over object projections.
- Return structured evidence packages with provenance, versions, and proof notes.
- Keep contracts stable enough for parallel development across modules.

## Current Architecture

The system is organized around three execution layers:

```
HTTP API (access)
    └─ Runtime (worker)
          ├─ WAL + Bus  (eventbackbone)
          ├─ MaterializeEvent → Memory / ObjectVersion / Edges  (materialization)
          ├─ PreComputeService → EvidenceFragment cache  (materialization)
          ├─ HotCache → TieredDataPlane (hot→warm→cold)  (dataplane)
          └─ Assembler.Build → BulkEdges + EvidenceCache  (evidence)
```

**Ingest path:**
`API → WAL.Append → MaterializeEvent → PutMemory + PutVersion + PutEdge → PreCompute → HotCache → TieredDataPlane.Ingest`

**Query path:**
`API → TieredDataPlane.Search → Assembler.Build → EvidenceCache.GetMany + BulkEdges(1-hop) → QueryResponse{Objects, Edges, ProofTrace}`

Code layout:

- [`src/internal/access`](src/internal/access): HTTP gateway, 14 routes including ingest, query, and canonical CRUD
- [`src/internal/coordinator`](src/internal/coordinator): 9 coordinators (schema, object, policy, version, worker, memory, index, shard, query) + module registry
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone`](src/internal/eventbackbone): WAL (`Append`/`Scan`/`LatestLSN`), Bus, HybridClock, WatermarkPublisher, DerivationLog
- [`src/internal/worker`](src/internal/worker): `Runtime.SubmitIngest` and `Runtime.ExecuteQuery` wiring
- [`src/internal/worker/nodes`](src/internal/worker/nodes): 14 worker-node type contracts (data, index, query, memory extraction, graph, proof trace, etc.)
- [`src/internal/dataplane`](src/internal/dataplane): `TieredDataPlane` (hot/warm/cold), `SegmentDataPlane`, and `DataPlane` interface
- [`src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore`](src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore): `Index`, `Shard`, `Searcher`, `Planner` — the physical segment layer
- [`src/internal/materialization`](src/internal/materialization): `Service.MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult{Record, Memory, Version, Edges}`; `PreComputeService`
- [`src/internal/evidence`](src/internal/evidence): `Assembler` (cache-aware, graph-expansion via `WithEdgeStore`), `EvidenceFragment`, `Cache`
- [`src/internal/storage`](src/internal/storage): 7 stores + `HotObjectCache` + `TieredObjectStore`; `GraphEdgeStore` with `BulkEdges`/`DeleteEdge`
- [`src/internal/semantic`](src/internal/semantic): `ObjectModelRegistry`, `PolicyEngine`, 5 query plan types
- [`src/internal/schemas`](src/internal/schemas): 13 canonical Go types + query/response contracts
- [`sdk/python`](sdk/python): Python SDK and bootstrap scripts
- [`cpp`](cpp): C++ retrieval stub for future high-performance execution
- [`src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane`](src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane): CGO bridge boundary — `bridge_stub.go` (default, no CGO) + `contracts.go` (Retriever/SearchService interfaces)
- [`src/internal/coordinator/controlplane`](src/internal/coordinator/controlplane): imported control-plane source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane`](src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane): imported stream/event source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/platformpkg`](src/internal/platformpkg): imported shared platform package subtree

## Worker Architecture

The execution layer is organised as a **cognitive dataflow pipeline** decomposed into eight layers, each with a defined responsibility boundary and pluggable InMemory implementation.

### 8-Layer Worker Model

| # | Layer | Workers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Data Plane** — Storage & Index | `IndexBuildWorker`, `SegmentWorker` _(compaction)_, `VectorRetrievalExecutor` |
| 2 | **Event / Log Layer** — WAL & Version Backbone | `IngestWorker`, `LogDispatchWorker` _(pub-sub)_, `TimeTick / TSO Worker` |
| 3 | **Object Layer** — Canonical Objects | `ObjectMaterializationWorker`, `StateMaterializationWorker`, `ToolTraceWorker` |
| 4 | **Cognitive Layer** — Memory Lifecycle | `MemoryExtractionWorker`, `MemoryConsolidationWorker`, `SummarizationWorker`, `ReflectionPolicyWorker`, `BaselineMemoryAlgorithm`, `MemoryBankAlgorithm` |
| 5 | **Structure Layer** — Graph & Tensor Structure | `GraphRelationWorker`, `EmbeddingBuilderWorker`, `TensorProjectionWorker` _(optional)_ |
| 6 | **Policy Layer** — Governance & Constraints | `PolicyWorker`, `ConflictMergeWorker`, `AccessControlWorker` |
| 7 | **Query / Reasoning Layer** — Retrieval & Reasoning | `QueryWorker`, `ProofTraceWorker`, `SubgraphExecutor`, `MicroBatchScheduler` |
| 8 | **Coordination Layer** — Multi-Agent Interaction | `CommunicationWorker`, `SharedMemorySyncWorker`, `ExecutionOrchestrator` |

All workers implement typed interfaces defined in [`src/internal/worker/nodes/contracts.go`](src/internal/worker/nodes/contracts.go) and are registered via the pluggable `Manager`. The `ExecutionOrchestrator` ([`src/internal/worker/orchestrator.go`](src/internal/worker/orchestrator.go)) dispatches tasks to chains with priority-aware queuing and backpressure.

> **Current implementation status:** Layers 1–4 and parts of 5–8 are fully implemented (including `SubgraphExecutorWorker` in `indexing/subgraph.go`). `VectorRetrievalExecutor`, `LogDispatchWorker`, `TSO Worker`, `EmbeddingBuilderWorker`, `TensorProjectionWorker`, `AccessControlWorker`, and `SharedMemorySyncWorker` are planned for v1.x / v2+.

### 4 Flow Chains

Defined in [`src/internal/worker/chain/chain.go`](src/internal/worker/chain/chain.go).

#### 🔴 Main Chain — primary write path

```
Request
  ↓
IngestWorker           (schema validation)
  ↓
WAL.Append             (event durability)
  ↓
ObjectMaterializationWorker  (Memory / State / Artifact routing)
  ↓
ToolTraceWorker        (tool_call artefact capture)
  ↓
IndexBuildWorker       (segment + keyword index)
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker    (derived_from edge)
  ↓
Response
```

#### 🟡 Memory Pipeline Chain — six-layer cognitive management

The memory pipeline implements the six-layer memory management architecture from the design specification.  Every path honours the core principle: **upper-layer agents may only consume `MemoryView`; they never access the raw object store or index directly.**

The pipeline separates **fixed generic infrastructure** from **algorithm-owned pipeline workers**:

- `AlgorithmDispatchWorker` and `GraphRelationWorker` are fixed nodes present in every deployment (`worker/cognitive/`).
- Everything else — extraction, consolidation, summarization, governance — is owned by the algorithm and lives under `worker/cognitive/<algo>/`.  Different algorithms may implement these stages completely differently, or omit stages they do not need.

**Materialization path — write-time (generic design):**

```
Event / Interaction
  ↓
[algo pipeline: materialization workers]   ← algorithm-specific
    e.g. raw event → level-0 memory → level-1 consolidation → level-2 summary
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker                        ← fixed
    relation binding: owned_by · derived_from · scoped_to · observed_by
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [ingest]           ← fixed
    algo.Ingest() → MemoryAlgorithmState persisted
    AlgorithmStateRef set on Memory
  ↓
[algo pipeline: governance workers]        ← algorithm-specific
    e.g. TTL / quarantine / confidence / salience rules
    → PolicyDecisionLog + AuditStore
```

**Materialization path — write-time (baseline algorithm concrete example):**

```
Event / Interaction
  ↓
baseline.MemoryExtractionWorker       level-0 episodic memory, LifecycleState=active
  ↓
baseline.MemoryConsolidationWorker    level-0 → level-1 semantic/procedural
  ↓
baseline.SummarizationWorker          level-1/level-2 compression
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [ingest]
  ↓
baseline.ReflectionPolicyWorker
    TTL expiry    → LifecycleState = decayed
    quarantine    → LifecycleState = quarantined
    confidence override · salience decay
    → PolicyDecisionLog + AuditStore
```

**Background maintenance path — async (generic, driven by AlgorithmDispatchWorker):**

```
Scheduler trigger
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [decay | compress | summarize]
    algo.Decay(nowTS)       → MemoryAlgorithmState · SuggestedLifecycleState honoured verbatim
    algo.Compress(memories) → derived Memory objects stored verbatim
    algo.Summarize(memories)→ summary Memory objects stored verbatim
    AuditRecord emitted for each state update
```

**Retrieval path — read-time (generic):**

```
QueryRequest
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [recall]
    algo.Recall(query, candidates) → ScoredRefs in algorithm order
  ↓
MemoryViewBuilder
    1. scope filter  — AccessGraphSnapshot.VisibleScopes
    2. policy filter — quarantined / hidden / logically-deleted excluded
    3. algorithm rerank — AlgorithmScorer func (pluggable)
    4. MemoryView assembled
  ↓
MemoryView{RequestID, ResolvedScope, VisibleMemoryRefs, Payloads,
           AlgorithmNotes, ConstructionTrace}
  ↓
Query Worker / Planner / Reasoner  (consumes MemoryView only)
```

**Algorithm plugin contract:**

- The `MemoryManagementAlgorithm` interface (`schemas/memory_management.go`) defines: `Ingest · Update · Recall · Compress · Decay · Summarize · ExportState · LoadState`.
- Lifecycle transitions are driven **exclusively** by `MemoryAlgorithmState.SuggestedLifecycleState` — the dispatcher applies no thresholds or heuristics of its own.
- Algorithm state is persisted in `MemoryAlgorithmStateStore` keyed by `(memory_id, algorithm_id)`, leaving the canonical `Memory` schema unchanged.
- Each algorithm is self-contained under `worker/cognitive/<algo>/` and registers its own pipeline workers; other algorithms (e.g. MemoryBank) plug in by implementing this interface without affecting existing deployments.

#### 🔵 Query Chain — retrieval + reasoning

```
QueryRequest
  ↓
TieredDataPlane.Search (hot → warm → cold)
  ↓
Assembler.Build
  ↓
EvidenceCache.GetMany + BulkEdges (1-hop graph expansion)
  ↓
ProofTraceWorker       (explainable trace assembly)
  ↓
QueryResponse{Objects, Edges, Provenance, ProofTrace}
```

#### 🟢 Collaboration Chain — multi-agent coordination with governed sharing

Memory sharing in a multi-agent system is **not** copying a record to a shared namespace.  It is a **controlled projection** — the original Memory retains its provenance and owner; the target agent receives a scope-filtered, policy-conditioned view.

```
Agent A writes Memory
  ↓
ConflictMergeWorker          (last-writer-wins · causal merge · conflict_resolved edge)
  ↓
ShareContract evaluation     (read_acl · write_acl · derive_acl
                               ttl_policy · consistency_level · merge_policy
                               quarantine_policy · audit_policy)
  ↓
AccessGraphSnapshot resolved (user → agent call-graph · agent → resource access-graph
                               → VisibleScopes for requesting agent at this moment)
  ↓
CommunicationWorker          (projection, not copy:
                               raw Memory keeps original owner + provenance
                               target agent receives scope-bound MemoryView)
  ↓
AuditRecord written          (record_id · target_memory_id · operation_type=share
                               actor_id · policy_snapshot_id · decision · timestamp)
  ↓
Target agent reads via MemoryViewBuilder
    scope filter  → AccessGraphSnapshot.VisibleScopes
    policy filter → quarantine / hidden / logically-deleted excluded
    algorithm rerank → pluggable AlgorithmScorer
    → MemoryView delivered to target Query Worker
```

**Key design principles:**

- **Sharing is projection, not copy** — provenance, owner, and base payload remain with the original object; what the target sees is a governance-conditioned view.
- **Access boundaries are dynamic** — `AccessGraphSnapshot` resolves visible scopes at request time, not as a static ACL field on the memory record.
- **Every share and projection is audited** — `AuditStore` records each share, read, algorithm-update, and policy-change action.
- **`ShareContract` is the protocol unit** — it encodes `read_acl`, `write_acl`, `derive_acl`, `ttl_policy`, `consistency_level`, `merge_policy`, `quarantine_policy`, and `audit_policy` as a first-class object rather than scattered metadata fields.

### ExecutionOrchestrator

The `Orchestrator` provides a priority-aware worker pool over the four chains:

| Priority | Level | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `PriorityUrgent` (3) | urgent | system health tasks |
| `PriorityHigh` (2) | high | ingest pipeline |
| `PriorityNormal` (1) | normal | memory pipeline, collaboration |
| `PriorityLow` (0) | low | background summarization |

Backpressure is enforced per priority queue (default 256 slots). Dropped tasks are counted in `OrchestratorStats.Dropped`.

## Canonical Objects in v1

The main v1 objects are:

- `Agent`
- `Session`
- `Event`
- `Memory`
- `State`
- `Artifact`
- `Edge`
- `ObjectVersion`

The current authoritative Go definitions live in [`src/internal/schemas/canonical.go`](src/internal/schemas/canonical.go).

## Query Contract in v1

The implemented ingest-to-query path:

`event ingest → canonical object materialization → retrieval projection → tiered search (hot→warm→cold) → 1-hop graph expansion → pre-computed evidence merge → structured QueryResponse`

The `QueryResponse` returned from every query includes:

- `Objects` — retrieved object IDs ranked by lexical score
- `Edges` — 1-hop graph neighbours of all retrieved objects
- `Provenance` — list of pipeline stages that contributed (`event_projection`, `retrieval_projection`, `fragment_cache`, `graph_expansion`)
- `Versions` — object version records (populated by version-aware queries)
- `AppliedFilters` — filters derived from the request by the `PolicyEngine`
- `ProofTrace` — step-by-step trace of how the response was assembled

Go contracts live in [`src/internal/schemas/query.go`](src/internal/schemas/query.go). Richer intended semantics are documented in the schema docs below.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go toolchain
- Python 3
- `pip`

### Install Python SDK dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./sdk/python
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
make dev
```

By default the server listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. You can override it with `ANDB_HTTP_ADDR`.

### Seed a mock event

```bash
python scripts/seed_mock_data.py
```

### Run the demo query

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

## Integration Tests

The integration test suite lives under `integration_tests/` (gitignored — for local dev only) and is split into two complementary layers:

| Layer | Location | What it tests |
|---|---|---|
| **Go HTTP tests** | `integration_tests/*_test.go` | All HTTP API routes, protocol, data-flow, topology — pure stdlib, no extra deps |
| **Python SDK tests** | `integration_tests/python/` | `AndbClient.ingest_event()` / `.query()` SDK wrapper + optional S3 dataflow |

### Prerequisites

- Go server is running: `make dev`
- For Python SDK tests: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e ./sdk/python`

### Full stack via Docker 

Root [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) starts **MinIO** (S3 API on port 9000), creates bucket `andb-integration`, and runs the Go server with **`ANDB_STORAGE=disk`**, **`ANDB_DATA_DIR=/data`**, and **`S3_*` pointing at MinIO** (cold tier uses real S3). Server listens on **`0.0.0.0:8080`** inside the container and is published as **http://127.0.0.1:8080**.

If `go mod` fails inside the `andb` container with TLS/x509 errors (corporate HTTPS inspection), add your CA as `.crt`/`.pem` under [`docker/custom-ca/`](docker/custom-ca/) (ignored by git) and optionally set **`GOPROXY`** / **`GOSUMDB`** in a repo-root `.env` for `docker compose`. The compose file wires an entrypoint that runs `update-ca-certificates` before `go run`.

```bash
docker compose up -d
# optional: fixture-driven JSON captures (stdlib HTTP only; no SDK install required)
python scripts/e2e/member_a_capture.py --out-dir ./out/member_a
make integration-test   # still expects a server at ANDB_BASE_URL (same URL)
```

Fixture sets and manifest: [`integration_tests/fixtures/member_a/`](integration_tests/fixtures/member_a/). Capture script: [`scripts/e2e/member_a_capture.py`](scripts/e2e/member_a_capture.py). Convenience targets: `make docker-up`, `make docker-down`, `make member-a-capture`.

### Run all integration tests

```bash
make integration-test
```

This runs `go test ./integration_tests/... -v` followed by `python integration_tests/python/run_all.py`.

### Run only Go tests

```bash
go test ./integration_tests/... -v -timeout 120s
```

### Run only Python SDK tests

```bash
cd integration_tests/python && python run_all.py
```

### Go test coverage

| File | Tests |
|---|---|
| `healthz_test.go` | `GET /healthz` — status 200, Content-Type |
| `ingest_query_test.go` | Ingest ack fields, LSN monotonicity, query evidence fields, top\_k, 400/405, E2E |
| `canonical_crud_test.go` | POST + GET for agents, sessions, memory, states, artifacts, edges, policies, share-contracts |
| `negative_test.go` | 405 on wrong method, 400 on malformed JSON, 404 on unknown routes |
| `protocol_test.go` | `Content-Type: application/json` on all response paths |
| `dataflow_test.go` | `provenance`, `proof_trace`, `applied_filters`, `edges`, `versions` after ingest→query |
| `topology_test.go` | `/v1/admin/topology` node count, `state=ready`, field presence, 405 |
| `s3_dataflow_test.go` | Ingest→query capture round-trip to S3 (**skipped** unless `ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS=true`) |

### Optional: S3/MinIO dataflow test

The S3 test (available in both Go and Python layers) ingests an event, runs a query, serialises the full capture as JSON, writes it to a MinIO bucket, and reads it back to verify byte-exact round-trip integrity.

**Start MinIO locally** (choose one):

```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name minio -p 9000:9000 \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \

**Run with S3 enabled:**

```bash
export ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS=true
export S3_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:9000
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
export S3_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
export S3_BUCKET=andb-integration
export S3_SECURE=false

make integration-test
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANDB_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Server address for all tests |
| `ANDB_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `10` | HTTP timeout in seconds (Python SDK) |
| `ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS` | _(empty)_ | Set to `true` to enable S3 dataflow tests |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | — | MinIO/S3 host:port |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` | — | Access key |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY` | — | Secret key |
| `S3_BUCKET` | — | Bucket name |
| `S3_SECURE` | `false` | Use TLS |
| `S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Region (MinIO ignores this) |
| `S3_PREFIX` | `andb/integration_tests` | Object key prefix |

To run only the Go internal module tests:

```bash
go test ./src/internal/... -count=1 -timeout 30s
```

All 12 packages have their own `*_test.go` file. See [`docs/contributing.md`](docs/contributing.md) for the module-level test specification.

## Roadmap

### v1 — current

- End-to-end event ingest and structured-evidence query 
- Tiered hot → warm → cold retrieval with RRF fusion 
- 1-hop graph expansion in every `QueryResponse` 
- Pre-computed `EvidenceFragment` cache merged into `ProofTrace` at query time 
- Go HTTP API with 14 routes, Python SDK, and integration test suite 
- Pluggable memory governance algorithms (Baseline + MemoryBank) 
- 10 embedding provider implementations (TF-IDF, OpenAI, Cohere, VertexAI, HuggingFace, ONNX, GGUF, TensorRT) 
- `include_cold` query flag fully wired 

### v1.x — near-term

- **DFS cold-tier search**: dense vector similarity over cold S3 embeddings (not just lexical cold search)
- Benchmark comparison against simple top-k retrieval
- Time-travel queries using WAL `Scan` replay
- Multi-agent session isolation and scope enforcement
- MemoryBank algorithm integration with Agent SDK endpoints

### v2+ — longer-term

- Policy-aware retrieval and visibility enforcement
- Stronger version and time semantics
- Share contracts and governance objects
- Richer graph reasoning and proof replay
- Tensor memory operators
- Cloud-native distributed orchestration
