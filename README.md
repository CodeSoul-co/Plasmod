# CogDB — Agent-Native Database for Multi-Agent Systems

CogDB (ANDB) is an agent-native database for multi-agent systems (MAS). It combines a tiered segment-oriented retrieval plane, an event backbone with an append-only WAL, a canonical object materialization layer, pre-computed evidence fragments, 1-hop graph expansion, and structured evidence assembly — all wired together as a single runnable Go server.

> **Core thesis:** agent memory, state, event, artifact, and relation should be modeled as first-class database objects, and query results should return structured evidence rather than only top-k text fragments.

## What is implemented

- Go server ([`src/cmd/server/main.go`](src/cmd/server/main.go)) with 14 HTTP routes
- Append-only WAL with `Scan` and `LatestLSN` for replay and watermark tracking
- `MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult` producing canonical `Memory`, `ObjectVersion`, and typed `Edge` records at ingest time
- Three-tier data plane: **hot** (in-memory LRU) → **warm** (segment index) → **cold** (archived tier), behind a unified `DataPlane` interface
- Pre-computed `EvidenceFragment` cache populated at ingest, merged into proof traces at query time
- 1-hop graph expansion via `GraphEdgeStore.BulkEdges` in the `Assembler.Build` path
- `QueryResponse` with `Objects`, `Edges`, `Provenance`, `ProofTrace`, `Versions`, and `AppliedFilters` on every query
- Module-level test coverage: 12 packages each with a `*_test.go` file
- Python SDK (`sdk/python`) and demo scripts
- Full architecture, schema, and API documentation

## Why This Project Exists

Most current agent memory stacks look like one of the following:

1. a vector database plus metadata tables
2. a chunk store used for RAG
3. an application-level event log or cache
4. a graph layer that is disconnected from retrieval execution

These approaches are useful but incomplete for MAS workloads that need:

- event-centric state evolution
- objectified memory and state management
- multi-representation retrieval
- provenance-preserving evidence return
- relation expansion and traceable derivation
- version-aware reasoning context

ANDB treats the database as cognitive infrastructure, not only as storage.

## v1 Design Goals

- Store canonical cognitive objects, not only vectors or chunks.
- Drive state evolution through events and materialization, not direct overwrite.
- Support dense, sparse, and filter-aware retrieval over object projections.
- Return structured evidence packages with provenance, versions, and proof notes.
- Keep contracts stable enough for parallel development across modules.

## Current Architecture

The system is organized around three execution layers:

```
HTTP API (access)
    └─ Runtime (worker)
          ├─ WAL + Bus  (eventbackbone)
          ├─ MaterializeEvent → Memory / ObjectVersion / Edges  (materialization)
          ├─ PreComputeService → EvidenceFragment cache  (materialization)
          ├─ HotCache → TieredDataPlane (hot→warm→cold)  (dataplane)
          └─ Assembler.Build → BulkEdges + EvidenceCache  (evidence)
```

**Ingest path:**
`API → WAL.Append → MaterializeEvent → PutMemory + PutVersion + PutEdge → PreCompute → HotCache → TieredDataPlane.Ingest`

**Query path:**
`API → TieredDataPlane.Search → Assembler.Build → EvidenceCache.GetMany + BulkEdges(1-hop) → QueryResponse{Objects, Edges, ProofTrace}`

Code layout:

- [`src/internal/access`](src/internal/access): HTTP gateway, 14 routes including ingest, query, and canonical CRUD
- [`src/internal/coordinator`](src/internal/coordinator): 9 coordinators (schema, object, policy, version, worker, memory, index, shard, query) + module registry
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone`](src/internal/eventbackbone): WAL (`Append`/`Scan`/`LatestLSN`), Bus, HybridClock, WatermarkPublisher, DerivationLog
- [`src/internal/worker`](src/internal/worker): `Runtime.SubmitIngest` and `Runtime.ExecuteQuery` wiring
- [`src/internal/worker/nodes`](src/internal/worker/nodes): 14 worker-node type contracts (data, index, query, memory extraction, graph, proof trace, etc.)
- [`src/internal/dataplane`](src/internal/dataplane): `TieredDataPlane` (hot/warm/cold), `SegmentDataPlane`, and `DataPlane` interface
- [`src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore`](src/internal/dataplane/segmentstore): `Index`, `Shard`, `Searcher`, `Planner` — the physical segment layer
- [`src/internal/materialization`](src/internal/materialization): `Service.MaterializeEvent` → `MaterializationResult{Record, Memory, Version, Edges}`; `PreComputeService`
- [`src/internal/evidence`](src/internal/evidence): `Assembler` (cache-aware, graph-expansion via `WithEdgeStore`), `EvidenceFragment`, `Cache`
- [`src/internal/storage`](src/internal/storage): 7 stores + `HotObjectCache` + `TieredObjectStore`; `GraphEdgeStore` with `BulkEdges`/`DeleteEdge`
- [`src/internal/semantic`](src/internal/semantic): `ObjectModelRegistry`, `PolicyEngine`, 5 query plan types
- [`src/internal/schemas`](src/internal/schemas): 13 canonical Go types + query/response contracts
- [`sdk/python`](sdk/python): Python SDK and bootstrap scripts
- [`cpp`](cpp): C++ retrieval stub for future high-performance execution
- [`src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane`](src/internal/dataplane/retrievalplane): imported retrieval-plane source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/coordinator/controlplane`](src/internal/coordinator/controlplane): imported control-plane source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane`](src/internal/eventbackbone/streamplane): imported stream/event source subtree (behind build tag)
- [`src/internal/platformpkg`](src/internal/platformpkg): imported shared platform package subtree

## Worker Architecture

The execution layer is organised as a **cognitive dataflow pipeline** decomposed into eight layers, each with a defined responsibility boundary and pluggable InMemory implementation.

### 8-Layer Worker Model

| # | Layer | Workers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Data Plane** — Storage & Index | `IndexBuildWorker`, `SegmentWorker` _(compaction)_, `VectorRetrievalExecutor` |
| 2 | **Event / Log Layer** — WAL & Version Backbone | `IngestWorker`, `LogDispatchWorker` _(pub-sub)_, `TimeTick / TSO Worker` |
| 3 | **Object Layer** — Canonical Objects | `ObjectMaterializationWorker`, `StateMaterializationWorker`, `ToolTraceWorker` |
| 4 | **Cognitive Layer** — Memory Lifecycle | `MemoryExtractionWorker`, `MemoryConsolidationWorker`, `SummarizationWorker`, `ReflectionPolicyWorker` |
| 5 | **Structure Layer** — Graph & Tensor Structure | `GraphRelationWorker`, `EmbeddingBuilderWorker`, `TensorProjectionWorker` _(optional)_ |
| 6 | **Policy Layer** — Governance & Constraints | `PolicyWorker`, `ConflictMergeWorker`, `AccessControlWorker` |
| 7 | **Query / Reasoning Layer** — Retrieval & Reasoning | `QueryWorker`, `ProofTraceWorker`, `SubgraphExecutor`, `MicroBatchScheduler` |
| 8 | **Coordination Layer** — Multi-Agent Interaction | `CommunicationWorker`, `SharedMemorySyncWorker`, `ExecutionOrchestrator` |

All workers implement typed interfaces defined in [`src/internal/worker/nodes/contracts.go`](src/internal/worker/nodes/contracts.go) and are registered via the pluggable `Manager`. The `ExecutionOrchestrator` ([`src/internal/worker/orchestrator.go`](src/internal/worker/orchestrator.go)) dispatches tasks to chains with priority-aware queuing and backpressure.

> **Current implementation status:** Layers 1–4 and parts of 5–8 are fully implemented (including `SubgraphExecutorWorker` in `indexing/subgraph.go`). `VectorRetrievalExecutor`, `LogDispatchWorker`, `TSO Worker`, `EmbeddingBuilderWorker`, `TensorProjectionWorker`, `AccessControlWorker`, and `SharedMemorySyncWorker` are planned for v1.x / v2+.

### 4 Flow Chains

Defined in [`src/internal/worker/chain/chain.go`](src/internal/worker/chain/chain.go).

#### 🔴 Main Chain — primary write path

```
Request
  ↓
IngestWorker           (schema validation)
  ↓
WAL.Append             (event durability)
  ↓
ObjectMaterializationWorker  (Memory / State / Artifact routing)
  ↓
ToolTraceWorker        (tool_call artefact capture)
  ↓
IndexBuildWorker       (segment + keyword index)
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker    (derived_from edge)
  ↓
Response
```

#### 🟡 Memory Pipeline Chain — six-layer cognitive management

The memory pipeline implements the six-layer memory management architecture from the design specification.  Every path honours the core principle: **upper-layer agents may only consume `MemoryView`; they never access the raw object store or index directly.**

The pipeline separates **fixed generic infrastructure** from **algorithm-owned pipeline workers**:

- `AlgorithmDispatchWorker` and `GraphRelationWorker` are fixed nodes present in every deployment (`worker/cognitive/`).
- Everything else — extraction, consolidation, summarization, governance — is owned by the algorithm and lives under `worker/cognitive/<algo>/`.  Different algorithms may implement these stages completely differently, or omit stages they do not need.

**Materialization path — write-time (generic design):**

```
Event / Interaction
  ↓
[algo pipeline: materialization workers]   ← algorithm-specific
    e.g. raw event → level-0 memory → level-1 consolidation → level-2 summary
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker                        ← fixed
    relation binding: owned_by · derived_from · scoped_to · observed_by
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [ingest]           ← fixed
    algo.Ingest() → MemoryAlgorithmState persisted
    AlgorithmStateRef set on Memory
  ↓
[algo pipeline: governance workers]        ← algorithm-specific
    e.g. TTL / quarantine / confidence / salience rules
    → PolicyDecisionLog + AuditStore
```

Current wiring status in code:

- `PipelineIngestWorker.Accept` invokes `DispatchAlgorithm("ingest", ...)` after canonical persistence and data-plane ingest, so each newly materialized Memory is processed by the registered algorithm dispatcher at write time.
- `Runtime.ExecuteQuery` invokes `DispatchAlgorithm("recall", ...)` through `MemoryViewBuilder` scoring.

**Materialization path — write-time (baseline algorithm concrete example):**

```
Event / Interaction
  ↓
baseline.MemoryExtractionWorker       level-0 episodic memory, LifecycleState=active
  ↓
baseline.MemoryConsolidationWorker    level-0 → level-1 semantic/procedural
  ↓
baseline.SummarizationWorker          level-1/level-2 compression
  ↓
GraphRelationWorker
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [ingest]
  ↓
baseline.ReflectionPolicyWorker
    TTL expiry    → LifecycleState = decayed
    quarantine    → LifecycleState = quarantined
    confidence override · salience decay
    → PolicyDecisionLog + AuditStore
```

**Background maintenance path — async (generic, driven by AlgorithmDispatchWorker):**

```
Scheduler trigger
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [decay | compress | summarize]
    algo.Decay(nowTS)       → MemoryAlgorithmState · SuggestedLifecycleState honoured verbatim
    algo.Compress(memories) → derived Memory objects stored verbatim
    algo.Summarize(memories)→ summary Memory objects stored verbatim
    AuditRecord emitted for each state update
```

**Retrieval path — read-time (generic):**

```
QueryRequest
  ↓
AlgorithmDispatchWorker [recall]
    algo.Recall(query, candidates) → ScoredRefs in algorithm order
  ↓
MemoryViewBuilder
    1. scope filter  — AccessGraphSnapshot.VisibleScopes
    2. policy filter — quarantined / hidden / logically-deleted excluded
    3. algorithm rerank — AlgorithmScorer func (pluggable)
    4. MemoryView assembled
  ↓
MemoryView{RequestID, ResolvedScope, VisibleMemoryRefs, Payloads,
           AlgorithmNotes, ConstructionTrace}
  ↓
Query Worker / Planner / Reasoner  (consumes MemoryView only)
```

**Algorithm plugin contract:**

- The `MemoryManagementAlgorithm` interface (`schemas/memory_management.go`) defines: `Ingest · Update · Recall · Compress · Decay · Summarize · ExportState · LoadState`.
- Lifecycle transitions are driven **exclusively** by `MemoryAlgorithmState.SuggestedLifecycleState` — the dispatcher applies no thresholds or heuristics of its own.
- Algorithm state is persisted in `MemoryAlgorithmStateStore` keyed by `(memory_id, algorithm_id)`, leaving the canonical `Memory` schema unchanged.
- Each algorithm is self-contained under `worker/cognitive/<algo>/` and registers its own pipeline workers; other algorithms (e.g. MemoryBank) plug in by implementing this interface without affecting existing deployments.

#### 🔵 Query Chain — retrieval + reasoning

```
QueryRequest
  ↓
TieredDataPlane.Search (hot → warm → cold)
  ↓
Assembler.Build
  ↓
EvidenceCache.GetMany + BulkEdges (1-hop graph expansion)
  ↓
ProofTraceWorker       (explainable trace assembly)
  ↓
QueryResponse{Objects, Edges, Provenance, ProofTrace}
```

#### 🟢 Collaboration Chain — multi-agent coordination with governed sharing

Memory sharing in a multi-agent system is **not** copying a record to a shared namespace.  It is a **controlled projection** — the original Memory retains its provenance and owner; the target agent receives a scope-filtered, policy-conditioned view.

```
Agent A writes Memory
  ↓
ConflictMergeWorker          (last-writer-wins · causal merge · conflict_resolved edge)
  ↓
ShareContract evaluation     (read_acl · write_acl · derive_acl
                               ttl_policy · consistency_level · merge_policy
                               quarantine_policy · audit_policy)
  ↓
AccessGraphSnapshot resolved (user → agent call-graph · agent → resource access-graph
                               → VisibleScopes for requesting agent at this moment)
  ↓
CommunicationWorker          (projection, not copy:
                               raw Memory keeps original owner + provenance
                               target agent receives scope-bound MemoryView)
  ↓
AuditRecord written          (record_id · target_memory_id · operation_type=share
                               actor_id · policy_snapshot_id · decision · timestamp)
  ↓
Target agent reads via MemoryViewBuilder
    scope filter  → AccessGraphSnapshot.VisibleScopes
    policy filter → quarantine / hidden / logically-deleted excluded
    algorithm rerank → pluggable AlgorithmScorer
    → MemoryView delivered to target Query Worker
```

**Key design principles:**

- **Sharing is projection, not copy** — provenance, owner, and base payload remain with the original object; what the target sees is a governance-conditioned view.
- **Access boundaries are dynamic** — `AccessGraphSnapshot` resolves visible scopes at request time, not as a static ACL field on the memory record.
- **Every share and projection is audited** — `AuditStore` records each share, read, algorithm-update, and policy-change action.
- **`ShareContract` is the protocol unit** — it encodes `read_acl`, `write_acl`, `derive_acl`, `ttl_policy`, `consistency_level`, `merge_policy`, `quarantine_policy`, and `audit_policy` as a first-class object rather than scattered metadata fields.

### ExecutionOrchestrator

The `Orchestrator` provides a priority-aware worker pool over the four chains:

| Priority | Level | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `PriorityUrgent` (3) | urgent | system health tasks |
| `PriorityHigh` (2) | high | ingest pipeline |
| `PriorityNormal` (1) | normal | memory pipeline, collaboration |
| `PriorityLow` (0) | low | background summarization |

Backpressure is enforced per priority queue (default 256 slots). Dropped tasks are counted in `OrchestratorStats.Dropped`.

## Canonical Objects in v1

The main v1 objects are:

- `Agent`
- `Session`
- `Event`
- `Memory`
- `State`
- `Artifact`
- `Edge`
- `ObjectVersion`

The current authoritative Go definitions live in [`src/internal/schemas/canonical.go`](src/internal/schemas/canonical.go).

## Query Contract in v1

The implemented ingest-to-query path:

`event ingest → canonical object materialization → retrieval projection → tiered search (hot→warm→cold) → 1-hop graph expansion → pre-computed evidence merge → structured QueryResponse`

The `QueryResponse` returned from every query includes:

- `Objects` — retrieved object IDs ranked by lexical score
- `Edges` — 1-hop graph neighbours of all retrieved objects
- `Provenance` — list of pipeline stages that contributed (`event_projection`, `retrieval_projection`, `fragment_cache`, `graph_expansion`)
- `Versions` — object version records (populated by version-aware queries)
- `AppliedFilters` — filters derived from the request by the `PolicyEngine`
- `ProofTrace` — step-by-step trace of how the response was assembled

Go contracts live in [`src/internal/schemas/query.go`](src/internal/schemas/query.go). Richer intended semantics are documented in the schema docs below.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go toolchain
- Python 3
- `pip`

### Install Python SDK dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ./sdk/python
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
make dev
```

By default the server listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. You can override it with `ANDB_HTTP_ADDR`.

### Seed a mock event

```bash
python scripts/seed_mock_data.py
```

### Run the demo query

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

## Integration Tests

The integration test suite lives under `integration_tests/` and is split into two complementary layers:

| Layer | Location | What it tests |
|---|---|---|
| **Go HTTP tests** | `integration_tests/*_test.go` | All HTTP API routes, protocol, data-flow, topology — pure stdlib, no extra deps |
| **Python SDK tests** | `integration_tests/python/` | `AndbClient.ingest_event()` / `.query()` SDK wrapper + optional S3 dataflow |

### Prerequisites

- Go server is running: `make dev`
- For Python SDK tests: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e ./sdk/python`

### Run all integration tests

```bash
make integration-test
```

This runs `go test ./integration_tests/... -v` followed by `python integration_tests/python/run_all.py`.

### Run only Go tests

```bash
go test ./integration_tests/... -v -timeout 120s
```

### Run only Python SDK tests

```bash
cd integration_tests/python && python run_all.py
```

### Go test coverage

| File | Tests |
|---|---|
| `healthz_test.go` | `GET /healthz` — status 200, Content-Type |
| `ingest_query_test.go` | Ingest ack fields, LSN monotonicity, query evidence fields, top\_k, 400/405, E2E |
| `canonical_crud_test.go` | POST + GET for agents, sessions, memory, states, artifacts, edges, policies, share-contracts |
| `negative_test.go` | 405 on wrong method, 400 on malformed JSON, 404 on unknown routes |
| `protocol_test.go` | `Content-Type: application/json` on all response paths |
| `dataflow_test.go` | `provenance`, `proof_trace`, `applied_filters`, `edges`, `versions` after ingest→query |
| `topology_test.go` | `/v1/admin/topology` node count, `state=ready`, field presence, 405 |
| `s3_dataflow_test.go` | Ingest→query capture round-trip to S3 (**skipped** unless `ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS=true`) |

### Optional: S3/MinIO dataflow test

The S3 test (available in both Go and Python layers) ingests an event, runs a query, serialises the full capture as JSON, writes it to a MinIO bucket, and reads it back to verify byte-exact round-trip integrity.

**Start MinIO locally** (choose one):

```bash
# Docker
docker run -d --name minio -p 9000:9000 \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data

# Binary (macOS arm64)
curl -sSL https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/darwin-arm64/minio -o /usr/local/bin/minio
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin minio server /tmp/minio-data --address :9000
```

**Run with S3 enabled:**

```bash
export ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS=true
export S3_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:9000
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
export S3_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
export S3_BUCKET=andb-integration
export S3_SECURE=false

make integration-test
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANDB_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Server address for all tests |
| `ANDB_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `10` | HTTP timeout in seconds (Python SDK) |
| `ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS` | _(empty)_ | Set to `true` to enable S3 dataflow tests |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | — | MinIO/S3 host:port |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` | — | Access key |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY` | — | Secret key |
| `S3_BUCKET` | — | Bucket name |
| `S3_SECURE` | `false` | Use TLS |
| `S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Region (MinIO ignores this) |
| `S3_PREFIX` | `andb/integration_tests` | Object key prefix |

To run only the Go internal module tests:

```bash
go test ./src/internal/... -count=1 -timeout 30s
```

All 12 packages have their own `*_test.go` file. See [`docs/contributing.md`](docs/contributing.md) for the module-level test specification.

## Integration Branch — Team Review Notes

> **Branch:** `integration/all-features-test`
> **Last updated:** 2026-03-24
> **Status:** All 21 Go internal packages pass (`go test ./src/internal/... exit 0`; `go vet ./... exit 0`). Six worker sub-packages have `*_test.go` files. Pass 2: 5 pipeline correctness fixes. Pass 3: 3 graph/storage structural fixes (R2/R6/R7). Pass 4: cold tier bug fix (TieredDataPlane ↔ TieredObjectStore integration).
> **Note:** This section exists only on `integration/all-features-test` and is intentionally not present on `main`.


### Remaining Open Items (blocking or near-term)

| ID | Description | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E1** | `TieredDataPlane.Ingest` never wrote to cold tier; `Flush()` never called | S3/Cold Module | ✅ Fixed |
| **E2** | `TieredObjectStore` (with `S3ColdStore`) completely bypassed in `SubmitIngest` — cold tier orphaned | S3/Cold Module | ✅ Fixed |
| **E3** | C++ Knowhere retrieval module (`retrievalplane`) never imported from query path — pure lexical search only | Member B | 🔲 Pending |
| **D1** | `subscriber.go` panic handler uses `log.Printf` instead of structured dead-letter channel | Member D | 🔲 Pending |

The following review checklist is intended for team members before merging `integration/all-features-test` → `main`.

---

### Member A — Schema & Query Filters (`feature/schema-a`)

**Scope merged:** Tenant/workspace filters, object/memory filter predicates on the query path.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Review focus** | ✅ | `QueryChainInput.EdgeTypeFilter` — verify edge-type filter from `QueryRequest` propagates to `SubgraphExecutorWorker` |
| **Review focus** | ✅ | `QueryChainInput.GraphNodes` / `GraphEdges` must be pre-fetched by caller before `QueryChain.Run` |
| Edge case: combined tenant + object-type + top_k filter | ✅ | Integration test covering the 3-way combination |
| Edge case: `ObjectTypes=["state"]` query after a `tool_call` ingest | ✅ | `StateMaterializationWorker` writes `State` on `tool_call` — confirm retrievable with type filter |

---

### Member B — Python Retrieval Service (`feature/retrieval-b`)

**Scope merged:** Dense/sparse retrieval Python service (C++ core + Python thin wrapper), policy filter, version filter, RRF merger, gRPC proto.

#### Architecture: Python Thin Wrapper + C++ Core

#### Three-Path Parallel Retrieval (C++)

| Path | Implementation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Dense** | `cpp/retrieval/dense.cpp` | Knowhere HNSW, Search with BitsetView |
| **Sparse** | `cpp/retrieval/sparse.cpp` | Knowhere SPARSE_INVERTED_INDEX |
| **Filter** | `cpp/retrieval/filter.cpp` | BitsetView passed to Search call |

**RRF Fusion** (`cpp/retrieval/merger.cpp`):
```
RRF_score(d) = Σ 1/(k + rank_i(d))    k=60 (configurable)
```

**Reranking formula**:
```cpp
final_score = rrf_score * max(importance, 0.01f)
                        * max(freshness_score, 0.01f)
                        * max(confidence, 0.01f)
```

**Seed marking**: candidates with `final_score >= seed_threshold` (default 0.7) set `is_seed=true` — used by `SubgraphExecutorWorker` for graph expansion.

#### Building the C++ Module

```bash
cd cpp && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DANDB_WITH_PYBIND=ON
make -j$(nproc)
```

| CMake Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANDB_WITH_KNOWHERE` | ON | Real Knowhere HNSW/SPARSE index (downloads zilliztech/knowhere v2.3.12; requires OpenBLAS) |
| `ANDB_WITH_PYBIND` | ON | Build pybind11 Python bindings |
| `ANDB_WITH_GPU` | OFF | GPU support via Knowhere RAFT |

Platforms: Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64, macOS Apple Silicon.

#### ⚡ Dual-Interface Ownership (Python ↔ Go) — B's Primary Responsibility

Member B is the **sole owner** of the contract boundary between the Python retrieval service and the Go HTTP layer. Any change to either side must be confirmed with the other side before merging.

**Go-side interface (owned by B, implemented in Go):**

| Go location | Python counterpart | What must stay in sync |
|---|---|---|
| `schemas.QueryRequest` (field names + JSON tags) | `andb_sdk/client.py` → `query()` kwargs | Field names, types, and omitempty rules |
| `schemas.QueryResponse` (JSON shape) | `andb_sdk/retrieval.py` → response parsing | `objects`, `edges`, `proof_trace`, `applied_filters` keys |
| `access/gateway.go` `/v1/query` POST body | `retrieval/service/retriever.py` request builder | HTTP method, path, Content-Type |
| `access/gateway.go` `/v1/ingest` POST body | `andb_sdk/client.py` → `ingest_event()` | `event_id`, `agent_id`, `session_id`, `payload` field presence |

**Proto contract (B must keep aligned):**

| File | Rule |
|---|---|
| `src/internal/retrieval/proto/retrieval.proto` | Proto field numbers must NOT change once merged — add new fields only, never renumber |
| gRPC service name | Must match the Go client stub if one is ever generated; agree with D before adding Go gRPC client |

**Checklist before B marks their section done:**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Knowhere C++ engine compiled | ✅ | `ANDB_WITH_KNOWHERE=ON` in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt` |
| **FIXED E3** | 🔲 | C++ Knowhere retrieval (`retrievalplane`) is never imported from Go query path — active search uses `segmentstore` lexical only; `segment_adapter.go` must be updated to call `retrievalplane.NewRetriever()` when `CGO_ENABLED=1` |
| SDK `query()` kwargs match current `QueryRequest` JSON shape | 🔲 | Run `integration_tests/python/run_all.py` |
| SDK `ingest_event()` matches current `/v1/ingest` body | 🔲 | Cross-check `workspace_id` field with A |
| Retry back-off in `merger.py` on upstream timeout | 🔲 | Add exponential back-off, max 3 retries |
| GPU support via Knowhere RAFT | 🔲 | v1.x / v2+ scope |
| No auth/TLS on Python service port | ⚠️ | Do NOT expose directly; require sidecar proxy |
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | C++ `is_seed=true` candidates → their IDs should map to `QueryChainInput.ObjectIDs` passed to `SubgraphExecutorWorker`; verify the Go gateway correctly extracts seed IDs from retrieval results before calling `QueryChain.Run` |
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | `proof_trace` field in `QueryResponse` may now contain up to depth=8 BFS steps (previously 1-hop); B's Python integration tests that assert `len(proof_trace) == N` must be updated to use `>= 1` instead of exact count |
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | When `S3ColdStore` is active, cold-path `GetMemory` adds HTTP round-trip latency; B's timeout settings in `retriever.py` may need to be increased from default if cold reads are expected during integration tests |

### Member C — Graph Relations (`feature/graph-c`)

**Scope merged:** `GraphRelationWorker`, `GraphEdgeStore.BulkEdges`, 1-hop expansion in `evidence.Assembler`, subgraph seed expansion.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | `OneHopExpand` iterates passed-in edges slice — verify `BulkEdges` and `OneHopExpand` return consistent results for the same seed set |
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | `conflict_resolved` edges from `ConflictMergeWorker` not surfaced in `QueryResponse.Edges` — confirm whether intentional |
| Missing: `GraphEdges` pre-fetch caller responsibility | 🔲 | `QueryChainInput.GraphEdges` must be pre-populated before `QueryChain.Run`; C and D must agree on ownership |

---

### Member D — Worker Architecture Refactor

**Scope merged:** Worker split into 5 domain subpackages, `Create*` naming convention, multi-hop ProofTrace, DerivationLog integration, SubgraphExecutorWorker (L5), StateMat + MicroBatch wiring.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **D1 — FIX** | 🔲 | `subscriber.go` panic handler uses `log.Printf` instead of structured dead-letter channel — replace with `sub.ErrorCh` dead-letter reporting before production |
| **Review focus** | ⚠️ | `ReflectionPolicyWorker` eviction — confirm uses `tiered_objects.ArchiveMemory()` not direct `store.Objects()` |
| Missing: `GraphEdges` pre-fetch in `QueryChain.Run` path | 🔲 | `QueryChainInput.GraphEdges` must be pre-populated; C and D must agree on ownership |

---

### S3 & Cold Storage Module

**Scope merged:** S3-compatible object storage (MinIO) for admin export, snapshot export, and cold-tier archival.

#### Admin API Endpoints (`src/internal/access/gateway.go`)

| Endpoint | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/admin/s3/export` | Ingest sample event → query → serialize → PUT to S3 → GET round-trip verify |
| `POST /v1/admin/s3/snapshot-export` | Write metadata JSON + manifest Avro + segment data JSON under `S3_PREFIX`; verify all three |

Snapshot key layout:
```
S3_PREFIX/snapshots/<collection_id>/metadata/<snapshot_id>.json
S3_PREFIX/snapshots/<collection_id>/manifests/<snapshot_id>/<segment_id>.avro
S3_PREFIX/segments/<collection_id>/<segment_id>/segment_data.json
```

#### S3 Utility Layer (`src/internal/storage/s3util.go`)

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LoadFromEnv()` | Load config from `S3_ENDPOINT / ACCESS_KEY / SECRET_KEY / BUCKET / SECURE / REGION / PREFIX` |
| `EnsureBucket()` | HEAD → auto-create bucket if absent |
| `PutBytesAndVerify()` | PUT + GET round-trip validation (admin export path) |
| `PutBytes()` | Simple PUT without round-trip verify (cold-store archival path) |
| `GetBytes()` | GET; returns `nil, nil` on 404 |
| `s3Sign()` | stdlib-only AWS Signature V4 (no external SDK) |

#### Cold-Tier Auto-Selection (`src/internal/storage/s3store.go` + `bootstrap.go`)

At startup, `bootstrap.go` selects the cold tier automatically:

```
When `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, and `S3_BUCKET` are set:
  → S3ColdStore  (MinIO / AWS S3 backed)
  → Log: [bootstrap] cold store: S3 endpoint=... bucket=...

Otherwise:
  → InMemoryColdStore  (in-process simulation, default)
  → Log: [bootstrap] cold store: in-memory simulation
```

`S3ColdStore` objects stored as:
- `{prefix}/cold/memories/{id}.json`
- `{prefix}/cold/agents/{id}.json`

#### Local One-Click Scripts (`scripts/dev/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ensure-docker.ps1` | Verify Docker availability (Windows) |
| `start-minio.ps1` | Start MinIO container for local S3 |
| `run-s3-runtime-export.ps1` | One-click runtime capture export |
| `run-s3-snapshot-export.ps1` | One-click snapshot/segment export |

Run artifacts: `scripts/dev/artifacts/...`

#### Reproducing Locally

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/dev/run-s3-snapshot-export.ps1"
```

Expected: `"status": "ok"` with all `roundtrip_ok` flags `true`.  
Run record: `scripts/dev/artifacts/s3-snapshot-export/<timestamp>/record.md`

#### Required env vars

```
S3_ENDPOINT    e.g. 127.0.0.1:9000
S3_ACCESS_KEY  e.g. minioadmin
S3_SECRET_KEY  e.g. minioadmin
S3_BUCKET      e.g. andb-integration
S3_SECURE      false (default)
S3_REGION      us-east-1 (default)
S3_PREFIX      andb/integration_tests (default)
```

#### S3 Module Review Checklist

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **FIXED E1** | ✅ | `TieredDataPlane` now uses `TieredObjectStore` as cold backend; `NewTieredDataPlane(tieredObjs)` accepts it; cold queries call `tieredObjs.ColdSearch()` |
| **FIXED E2** | ✅ | `SubmitIngest` now calls `tieredObjs.PutMemory()` + `tieredObjs.ArchiveColdRecord()`; `Runtime` holds `TieredObjectStore` reference |
| `InMemoryColdStore.ColdSearch` | ✅ | Lexical substring search over cold memories, sorted by score+recency |
| `S3ColdStore.ColdSearch` | ✅ | ListObjectsV2 + per-key GET + lexical scoring; `ListObjects` added to `s3util` |
| Missing: S3 integration test in `integration_tests/` | ✅ | `integration_tests/s3_dataflow_test.go` added; run with `ANDB_RUN_S3_TESTS=true` |
| Missing: `S3_*` config key standardisation | ✅ | `storage.LoadFromEnv()` now standardizes on `S3_*` and supports `MINIO_*` aliases for compatibility |
